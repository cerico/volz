  body: 'The name Todmorden is first attested in 1246, in the form Totmardene;[5] other pre-modern spellings include Tottemerden, Totmereden and Totmerden.[6] This is thought to originate in Old English as a personal name, Totta, combined with the Old English words m«£re ("border, boundary") and denu ("valley"). Thus the name once meant "Totta"s border-valley".[5][6] The valley in question is thought to have been the one running north-west from the town,[6] and the border the one between Lancashire and Yorkshire.',
